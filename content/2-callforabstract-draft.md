# Call for Abstracts &mdash; FTQCSA 2025

The pdf version is [here](/assets/pdf/FTQCSA2025-CFA.pdf).

## Abstract
Fault-tolerant quantum computing System Architecture (FTQCSA 2025) is a workshop in conjunction with ISCA 2025 in Tokyo at the aim of constructing a community of researchers who are interested in system architecture of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQCs).

## Motivation
Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) is a promising field that requires expertise across multiple disciplines to achieve quantum advantage. To overcome the complex challenges ahead, sustained efforts and international collaboration are essential. The FTQCSA workshop aims to bring together experts from diverse disciplines to share their advancements, discuss system-level challenges, and collaborate on strategies to accelerate FTQC development, ultimately driving progress toward realizing quantum advantages.

## Scope
Topics of interest of the FTQCSA workshop include, but are not limited to:

- Scalable system design of fault-tolerant quantum computers
- Realtime quantum error decoding system
- Resource reductions to demonstrate quantum advantage
- Compilation techniques and application performance evaluation of distributed quantum computing
- Quantum computer design based on emerging error correction codes (e.g., Quantum LDPC codes)

## Workshop format
The FTQCSA2025 will feature a mix of invited talks, and presentations/posters selected from submissions to this call for participation. Authors can submit an abstract, a preprint, or a published paper. 
Submissions of works in progress and position papers are encouraged, and we also welcome previously published works. Preprints or published articles can be submitted in lieu of an abstract. As no formal proceedings are planned, submissions will not preclude publication at future conference venues.

The submission options are as follows:
- _Two-page abstract:_ An abstract should be prepared in PDF format (fontsize: 9 pt, US letter size: 8.5 in &times; 11 in, up to two pages including reference). The abstract should include the title, authors, affiliations, and email address of the contact author. When the submission is accepted, the abstract will be shared with only the workshop attendees.
-  _Published Paper:_ In the case of the submission with a preprint or a published paper, please attach the PDF file of the paper. The workshop will not share the article with attendees.
 
## Important dates
- _Abstract submissions:_ April 18 (Fri) AoE
- _Author notification:_ May 9 (Fri)
- _Workshop Date:_ June 22 (Sun)

## Submission
Please submit your abstract [here](/submit/).
