## About FTQCSA

The pursuit of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC) represents a promising direction in enhancing computation capability, with far-reaching implications for various fields. However, the research and development of FTQC necessitate a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on expertise from diverse areas, including quantum coding theory, quantum processing unit design, electronics engineering for quantum-classical interfaces, quantum networks, computer architecture, compilation techniques, and FTQC integration with high-performance computing. As we embark on the path to achieving quantum advantage through FTQC, it is clear that sustained efforts are required to scale up FTQC systems while reducing the resources needed to operate them.

The journey toward harnessing the power of FTQC has just begun, and it is essential to recognize that long-term commitment and collaboration are crucial for overcoming the complex challenges ahead. In this context, the motivation behind this workshop lies in the need to foster international cooperation among researchers from diverse disciplines. The primary objective of this workshop is to provide a platform where experts can converge to share their latest advancements, discuss system-level challenges, and collaborate on strategies to accelerate the development of FTQC systems. By facilitating an exchange of ideas and expertise, we aim to drive progress toward realizing quantum advantages.
